If you do not provide consul address default use environment variables.

## Environment

Supported environment variables:

``` go
// HTTPAddrEnvName defines an environment variable name which sets
// the HTTP address if there is no -http-addr specified.
HTTPAddrEnvName = "CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR"

// HTTPTokenEnvName defines an environment variable name which sets
// the HTTP token.
HTTPTokenEnvName = "CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN"

// HTTPAuthEnvName defines an environment variable name which sets
// the HTTP authentication header.
HTTPAuthEnvName = "CONSUL_HTTP_AUTH"

// HTTPSSLEnvName defines an environment variable name which sets
// whether or not to use HTTPS.
HTTPSSLEnvName = "CONSUL_HTTP_SSL"

// HTTPCAFile defines an environment variable name which sets the
// CA file to use for talking to Consul over TLS.
HTTPCAFile = "CONSUL_CACERT"

// HTTPCAPath defines an environment variable name which sets the
// path to a directory of CA certs to use for talking to Consul over TLS.
HTTPCAPath = "CONSUL_CAPATH"

// HTTPClientCert defines an environment variable name which sets the
// client cert file to use for talking to Consul over TLS.
HTTPClientCert = "CONSUL_CLIENT_CERT"

// HTTPClientKey defines an environment variable name which sets the
// client key file to use for talking to Consul over TLS.
HTTPClientKey = "CONSUL_CLIENT_KEY"

// GRPCAddrEnvName defines an environment variable name which sets the gRPC
